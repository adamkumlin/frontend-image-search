# Search engine website utilizing Pixabay API
This is a search engine website written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS that communicates with the <a href="https://github.com/dderevjanik/pixabay-api">Pixabay API</a> (<a href="https://pixabay.com/api/docs/">Documentation</a>)

# Assignment
Write a search engine using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches its images from Pixabay. The exact design and content are up to you, but you must meet the following requirements:

- Users should be able to enter a search term and choose a color for the images. They should also be able to select "any color" and see images regardless of color.
- Next to each image, there should be the image tags (Pixabay images do not have titles) and the photographer's name.
- There should be buttons for "previous page" and "next page" to navigate between search results. These buttons should be disabled when the user is on the first or last page.
- The search engine should display 10 images at a time.
- Refer to the documentation for the Pixabay API to learn how the API is used and what it can do.
- You need an API key to use the API, which you can obtain by creating a Pixabay account.
- The website should have semantic HTML and a responsive design.
- Do not use any libraries or frameworks; only your own code.
